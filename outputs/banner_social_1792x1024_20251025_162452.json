  "revised_prompt": "Create a professional digital banner advertisement sized 1200x628 pixels for a tech store's Black Friday Sale. The banner design must be in a clean, modern, and professional advertising style with a simple layout that makes the text the focus. The typography should be in sans-serif fonts, with high contrast making it very legible. The brand name 'TechStore' should appear as the largest, boldest text element, preferably placed at the top or center of the banner. The main sale message, 'Up to 70% off' should be displayed in the center area, in a medium size font. The call-to-action button, labeled 'Shop Now', should be set in a prominent position on the bottom. Important is to highlight the CTA with a bright color. The design color scheme should be professional, vibrant, and eye-catching. An immaculate or subtly detailed background that does not disrupt the legibility of the text should be implemented. Adhere to rules of professionalism with high contrast between text and background, crystal clear readability, and absence of decorative text or unnecessary words. The priority is perfect text visibility.",
