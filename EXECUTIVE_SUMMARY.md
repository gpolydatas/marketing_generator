## Competitive Advantage

### Why This Solution?

**1. Conversational Interface**
- Most tools require form-filling
- Our agent understands natural language
- Context-aware for iterative refinement

**2. End-to-End Automation**
- Generate + validate + iterate automatically
- Other tools require manual review
- Reduces time from hours to minutes

**3. Multi-Modal**
- Banners AND videos in one platform
- Most tools do one or the other
- Consistent branding across formats

**4. Quality Assurance**
- Automatic validation with AI
- Regenerates until quality threshold met
- Ensures professional output

**Q: What happens if the AI makes a mistake?**
A: The validation system catches quality issues and automatically regenerates up to 3 times.

**Q: How long does generation take?**
A: Banners: 10-30 seconds. Videos: 1-3 minutes.

**Q: Can we generate multiple variants?**
A: Currently one at a time, but batch generation is on the roadmap.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: This is a POC. Production hardening would take 4-8 additional weeks.

**Q: What are the API costs?**
A: ~$0.08 per banner, ~$0.50 per video. Much cheaper than manual design.
